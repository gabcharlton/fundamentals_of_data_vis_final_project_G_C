# Best Selling Books - Fundamentals of Data Visualization Final Project

## Overview 
The dataset I will be using is the best-selling-books dataset made by D Rahulsingh (Kaggle Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drahulsingh/best-selling-books). 
This dataset holds data regarding best selling books. The main columns of this dataset I will use include:
* Book                             
* Author(s)                         
* Original language                
* First published                   
* Approximate sales in millions    
* Genre
   
For this exercise, I'm imagining that I am at a point in my life when I am considering a drastic career change. A career I've always wanted was to open a bookstore. In preparation for opening my own book store, I am having a hard time finding classics for my books inventory. The main goal for me is to know what books are most guaranteed for sales and success. I would like to know:

What kinds of books are the most popular?
* What genre typically sells the most?
* Which author typically has sold the most ?
* What original language is the most popular for books sold?

What are the trends with popular book sales over the years?
* What has been the most popular genre over the years?
* Who has been the most popular author over the years?
* What has been the most popular original language over the years?
